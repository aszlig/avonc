        "description": "[Pico CMS for Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/cms_pico) combines the power of [**Pico**](http://picocms.org/) and [**Nextcloud**](https://nextcloud.com/) to create simple, secure, shareable and amazingly powerful websites with just a few clicks. Pico is a stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS - making the web easy.\n\n* Start a blog\n* Share your resume with the world\n* Create a plan for world domination and only share with the right friends\n* Build a knowledge base and let the smart ones among your colleagues help out\n\nInstalling Pico CMS for Nextcloud allows your users to create and manage their own websites. Creating a new page with Pico is no more than creating a simple text file in a users' Nextcloud files. No config is required, no utterly complex management interfaces - just files. It's the perfect match with Nextcloud. Secure Sharing, Collaboration, Access Control - not just for your files, but also your websites, all made possible by Pico CMS for Nextcloud! Breaking the boundaries between your Mobile &amp; Desktop devices and your Server.\n\nWebsites will be accessible through URLs like `https://cloud.example.com/sites/my_site/` and consist of just a bunch of `.md` text files in a user's Nextcloud files. `.md` stands for [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - a super simple and intuitive markup to create headings, paragraphs, text formatting, lists, images and links. But don't despair - you don't have to learn yet another language if you don't want to. Consider enabling Nextcloud's [Text](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/text) or [Markdown Editor](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_markdown) apps to make easy things stupidly simple. But what about meta data like a page's title or release date? Guess right, it's all in one place. At the top of your Markdown files you can place a block with such meta data - called the [**YAML**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) Front Matter. Creating websites can't be easier...\n\nBut that wasn't everything... Pico CMS for Nextcloud is highly customizable. You can change Picos appearance by using custom themes and add new functionality by using custom plugins. For security reasons users can neither add custom themes nor plugins on their own - but as an admin you can. Plugins and themes arent just new \"skins\" or \"widgets\", the underlying technologies are powerful frameworks you can leverage to make your users' websites truly unique. However, with great power comes great responsibility. Pico CMS for Nextcloud does its best to prevent users from including scripts into websites, since this might bear security risks (so called \"Cross Scripting\"). Since this risk doesn't apply to Pico itself, 3rd-party developers of plugins and themes might not be aware of this issue - so be careful when installing custom plugins and themes.\n\nYou want to learn more about Pico CMS for Nextcloud? Easy! Just download and enable the app from [Nextcloud's App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/cms_pico) and navigate to Nextcloud's settings page. As an admin you'll find two \"Pico CMS\" sections in your Nextcloud settings - one below \"Personal\", another below \"Administration\". The latter allows you to add custom themes, plugins and templates to Pico, as well as tweaking some advanced settings. The \"Pico CMS\" section below \"Personal\" exists for all Nextcloud users and allows one to create personal websites. Simply create your first personal website and choose \"sample_pico\" as website template. Pico's sample contents will explain all you need to know...",

It works for publications formatted according to the following standards:\n\n - [Epub]\n - [PDF]\n - [CBR and CBZ] ('comics')\n\nFor Epub Reader uses the futurepress [epub.js] renderer to provide near-native looks, especially when used full-screen. Turn pages by pressing the left/right hand side of the screen/window or using the cursor keys (if you have those), use the sidebar to browse through chapters or bookmarks and add annotations.\n\nPDF is handled by Mozilla's [pdf.js] renderer in combination with a custom reader app to enable side-by-side display, batch search and more. Controls are like those used in the Epub renderer with a few exceptions, e.g. night mode has not been implemented yet.\n\nCBR and CBZ are supported using a custom renderer inspired by [balaclark]'s work. As with Epub, books can be navigated using the keyboard as well as mouse or touch navigation. Reader generates a visual index of all pages, show in the sidebar (thumbnail generation can be disabled for low-memory and/or -speed devices). As CBx files are often of varying quality, a set of image enhancement filters are provided.\n\nSee [README] for more exhaustive information on features and potential misfeatures of this app.\n\n   [epub.js]: https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js\n   [Epub]: http://idpf.org/epub\n   [CBR and CBZ]: https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/CBR_and_CBZ\n   [balaclark]: https://github.com/balaclark/HTML5-Comic-Book-Reader\n   [PDF]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format\n   [pdf.js]: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js\n   [README]: https://github.com/e-alfred/epubreader/blob/master/epubreader/README.md",

Files can be loaded in GpxEdit interface or in Files app.\n\nGo to [GpxEdit Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/gpxedit) if you want to help to translate this app in your language.\n\nThis is not a perfect GPX editor.\n\nWhat's saved :\n- metadata\n    - name\n    - link url\n    - link text\n- tracks\n    - name\n    - comment\n    - description\n    - points\n        - coordinates\n        - elevation (just preserves loaded values)\n        - time (just preserves loaded values)\n- waypoint\n    - coordinates\n    - name\n    - comment\n    - description\n    - symbol\n    - elevation (just preserves loaded value)\n    - time (just preserves loaded values)\n\nGpxEdit does load/save time data. Elevation data is loaded and saved but every new waypoint/track/trackpoint added by user actions in GpxEdit will have neither elevation nor time data. There is an \"approximate\" option to set elevation to new points if surrounding points have elevation data.\n\nTracks are saved with one segment (trkseg tag).\n\nGpxEdit :\n- allows you to add extra symbols in admin settings (section : additional)\n- works with server-side encryption.\n- works with shared files.\n- loads GPX, KML, unicsv CSV, geotagged JPG files (no more Gpsbabel dependency)\n- loads tracks, routes and waypoints\n- saves tracks, routes and waypoints\n- supports waypoint symbols\n- uses [Leaflet.Draw](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw) and [Leaflet.draw.plus](https://github.com/Dominique92/Leaflet.draw.plus) amazing plugins\n- uses many other Leaflet plugins like Minimap, Sidebar2, MeasureControl, MousePositionControl\n- adds possibility to edit .gpx files directly from the \"Files\" app\n- is able to cut lines in two\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 14 with Firefox and Chromium.\n\nAny feedback will be appreciated.\n\n## Installation\n\nCheck the [AdminDoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/gpxedit-oc/wikis/admindoc) for installation details, integration in \"Files\" app and GpxEdit admin settings.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nIf you look for more powerfull GPX editors, take a look at :\n- [Viking](https://sourceforge.net/projects/viking/) which is the best IMHO\n- [QLandKarteGT](https://bitbucket.org/kiozen/qlandkarte-gt)\n- [QMapShack](https://bitbucket.org/maproom/qmapshack/wiki/Home)\n- [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/)\n\n\n\n## Donation\n\nI develop this app during my free time.\n\n* [Donate with Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=66PALMY8SF5JE) (you don't need a paypal account)\n* [Donate with Liberapay : ![Donate using Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/eneiluj/donate)",

        "description": "# PhoneTrack Nextcloud application\n\n PhoneTrack is a Nextcloud application to track and store mobile device's locations.\n\n It receives information from mobile phone's logging apps and displays it dynamically on a map.\n\n Help us to translate this app on [PhoneTrack Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/phonetrack).\n\n Check out other ways to help in the [contribution guidelines](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nHow to use PhoneTrack :\n\n* Create a tracking session.\n* Give the logging link\\* to the mobile devices. Choose the [logging method](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#logging-methods) you prefer.\n* Watch the session's devices location in real time (or not) in PhoneTrack or share it with public pages.\n\n(\\*) Don't forget to set the device name in the link (rather than in the logging app settings). Replace \"yourname\" with the desired device name. Setting the device name in logging app settings only works with Owntracks, Traccar and OpenGTS.\n\nOn PhoneTrack main page, while watching a session, you can :\n\n*  Display location history\n*  Filter points\n*  Manually edit/add/delete points\n*  Edit devices (rename, change colour/shape, move to another session)\n*  Define geofencing zones for devices\n*  Define proximity alerts for device pairs\n*  Share a session to other Nextcloud users or with a public link (read-only)\n*  Generate public share links with optional restrictions (filters, device name, last positions only, geofencing simplification)\n*  Import/export a session in GPX format (one file with one track per device or one file per device)\n*  Display sessions statistics\n*  [Reserve a device name](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#device-name-reservation) to make sure only authorised user can log with this name\n*  Toggle session auto export and auto purge (daily/weekly/monthly)\n*  Choose what to do when point number quota is reached (block logging or delete oldest point)\n\nPublic page and public filtered page work like main page except there is only one session displayed, everything is read-only and there is no need to be logged in.\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 17 with Firefox 57+ and Chromium.\n\nThis app is compatible with theming colours and accessibility themes !\n\nThis app is under development.\n\n## Install\n\nSee the [AdminDoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc) for installation details.\n\nCheck [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#change-log) file to see what's new and what's coming in next release.\n\nCheck [AUTHORS](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/AUTHORS.md#authors) file to see complete list of authors.\n\n## Known issues\n\n* PhoneTrack **now works** with Nextcloud group restriction activated. See [admindoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc#issue-with-phonetrack-restricted-to-some-groups-in-nextcloud).\n\nAny feedback will be appreciated.\n\n## Donation\n\nI develop this app during my free time.\n\n* [Donate with Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=66PALMY8SF5JE) (you don't need a paypal account)\n* [Donate with Liberapay : ![Donate using Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/eneiluj/donate)",

For that you should specify \"Groups claim\" in custom OAuth2/OIDC provider settings. That claim should be returned from provider in `id_token` or at user info endpoint. Format should be `array` or comma separated string. Eg (with claim named `roles`)\n\n```json\n{\"roles\": [\"admin\", \"user\"]}\nor\n{\"roles\": \"admin,user\"}\n```\n\nAlso nested claims is supported. For example `resource_access.client-id.roles` for\n\n```json\n\"resource_access\": {\n   \"client-id\": {\n     \"roles\": [\n       \"client-role-1\",\n       \"client-role-2\"\n     ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\n\nYou can use provider groups in two ways:\n\n1.

Create provider groups in nextcloud and associate it to user (if appropriate option specified)\n\nIf you want sync groups on every login do not forget to check \"Update user profile every login\" setting\n\nYou can find example how to configure WSO2IS for return roles claim with OIDC at https://medium.com/@dewni.matheesha/claim-mapping-and-retrieving-end-user-information-in-wso2is-cffd5f3937ff\n\n## Built-in OAuth providers\n\nYou can copy link of certain login button to get proper \"redirect url\" for OAuth app setting.\n\n* [Google](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/google.md)\n* [Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/loginwithamazon/console/site/lwa/overview.html)\n* [Facebook](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/facebook.md)\n* [Twitter](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/twitter.md)\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers)\n* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me#top)\n* [Telegram](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/telegram.md)\n\nDetails about \"Allow login only from specified domain\" google setting you can find here [#44](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/issues/44)\nYou can use comma separated list for multiple domains\n\n## Config\n\nYou can use `'social_login_auto_redirect' =&gt; true` setting in `config.php` for auto redirect unauthorized users to social login if only one provider is configured.\nIf you want to temporary disable this function (e.g. for login as local admin), you can add `noredir=1` query parameter in url for login page. Something like `https://cloud.domain.com/login?noredir=1`\n\n## Hint\n\n### About Callback(Reply) Url\nYou can copy link from specific login button on login page and paste it on provider's website as callback url. To make proper button visible, just fill certain provider settings with random data and change it later.\n\nSome users may get strange reply(Callback) url error from provider even if you pasted the right url, that's because your nextcloud server may generate http urls when you are actually using https.\nPlease set 'overwriteprotocol' =&gt; 'https', in your config.php file.",
