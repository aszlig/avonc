This approach, however, has some drawbacks, e.g., that [newly added users can't see files shared with the Everyone group before the user was created](https://github.com/icewind1991/group_everyone/issues/16). In contrast to \"Everyone Group\", the \"Auto Groups\" app operates on real groups in your normal Group Backend. Additionally, it is possible to specify Override Groups which will prevent users from being added to the Auto Group(s).\n* [Default Group](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/defaultgroup): The \"Default Group\" app has actually been the base for \"Auto Groups\". However, there are a few distinctions, most notably that \"Auto Groups\" removes users from the Auto Groups in case they are added to one of the Override Groups later on. Futhermore, \"Default Groups\" has not been updated for some time and is officially not supporting NC13 and above. In contrast, \"Auto Groups\" features community-powered translations, automated tests and is not using the deprecated Hook mechanism anymore.",

Pico is a stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS - making the web easy.\n\n* Start a blog\n* Share your resume with the world\n* Create a plan for world domination and only share with the right friends\n* Build a knowledge base and let the smart ones among your colleagues help out\n\nInstalling Pico CMS for Nextcloud allows your users to create and manage their own websites. Creating a new page with Pico is no more than creating a simple text file in a users' Nextcloud files. No config is required, no utterly complex management interfaces - just files. It's the perfect match with Nextcloud. Secure Sharing, Collaboration, Access Control - not just for your files, but also your websites, all made possible by Pico CMS for Nextcloud! Breaking the boundaries between your Mobile &amp; Desktop devices and your Server.\n\nWebsites will be accessible through URLs like `https://cloud.example.com/sites/my_site/` and consist of just a bunch of `.md` text files in a user's Nextcloud files. `.md` stands for [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - a super simple and intuitive markup to create headings, paragraphs, text formatting, lists, images and links. But don't despair - you don't have to learn yet another language if you don't want to. Consider enabling Nextcloud's [Text](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/text) or [Markdown Editor](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_markdown) apps to make easy things stupidly simple. But what about meta data like a page's title or release date? Guess right, it's all in one place. At the top of your Markdown files you can place a block with such meta data - called the [**YAML**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) Front Matter. Creating websites can't be easier...\n\nBut that wasn't everything... Pico CMS for Nextcloud is highly customizable. You can change Picos appearance by using custom themes and add new functionality by using custom plugins. For security reasons users can neither add custom themes nor plugins on their own - but as an admin you can. Plugins and themes arent just new \"skins\" or \"widgets\", the underlying technologies are powerful frameworks you can leverage to make your users' websites truly unique. However, with great power comes great responsibility. Pico CMS for Nextcloud does its best to prevent users from including scripts into websites, since this might bear security risks (so called \"Cross Scripting\"). Since this risk doesn't apply to Pico itself, 3rd-party developers of plugins and themes might not be aware of this issue - so be careful when installing custom plugins and themes.\n\nYou want to learn more about Pico CMS for Nextcloud? Easy! Just download and enable the app from [Nextcloud's App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/cms_pico) and navigate to Nextcloud's settings page. As an admin you'll find two \"Pico CMS\" sections in your Nextcloud settings - one below \"Personal\", another below \"Administration\". The latter allows you to add custom themes, plugins and templates to Pico, as well as tweaking some advanced settings. The \"Pico CMS\" section below \"Personal\" exists for all Nextcloud users and allows one to create personal websites. Simply create your first personal website and choose \"sample_pico\" as website template. Pico's sample contents will explain all you need to know...",

Controls are like those used in the Epub renderer with a few exceptions, e.g. night mode has not been implemented yet.\n\nCBR and CBZ are supported using a custom renderer inspired by [balaclark]'s work. As with Epub, books can be navigated using the keyboard as well as mouse or touch navigation. Reader generates a visual index of all pages, show in the sidebar (thumbnail generation can be disabled for low-memory and/or -speed devices). As CBx files are often of varying quality, a set of image enhancement filters are provided.\n\nSee [README] for more exhaustive information on features and potential misfeatures of this app\n\n   [epub.js]: https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js\n   [Epub]: http://idpf.org/epub\n   [CBR and CBZ]: https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/CBR_and_CBZ\n   [balaclark]: https://github.com/balaclark/HTML5-Comic-Book-Reader\n   [PDF]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format\n   [pdf.js]: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js\n   [README]: https://github.com/e-alfred/epubreader/blob/master/epubreader/README.md",

That for example enables you to search in it.\n\n## Prerequisites, Requirements and Dependencies\nThe OCR app has some prerequisites:\n\n - [Nextcloud 16 and up](https://nextcloud.com/)\n\n - Only supported on latest modern web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, Safari*)\n\n - Tesseract traineddata needs about 200 MB space on your server (will be installed automatically).\n\n\n_* On Safari there is currently a problem with the [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), that requires an Administrator to set the 'script-src' to 'unsafe-eval' such that the app works properly. Because this is quite insecure the app itself does not set it and recommends to decide that on your own risk (please make sure, that you know what CSP is and what e.g. unsafe-eval causes)._\n\n## Installation\nInstall the app from the [Nextcloud AppStore](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/ocr) or download the release package from github (**NOT** the sources) and place the content in **nextcloud/apps/ocr/**.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThe software is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR\nCONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n\n## Note\nThe version 3 and earlier versions are not supported/maintained anymore by the author. So for asynchronous background processing please fork the repository and use the \"not-maintained\" branch to work on improvements. The author wasn't able to support it because of too much effort.\nMoreover this project is based on a webassembly port of tesseract. The maintainer stopped working on PDF processing in this app and will start working on separate app for pdf handling.",

Choose the [logging method](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#logging-methods) you prefer.\n* Watch the session's devices location in real time (or not) in PhoneTrack or share it with public pages.\n\n(\\*) Don't forget to set the device name in the link (rather than in the logging app settings). Replace \"yourname\" with the desired device name. Setting the device name in logging app settings only works with Owntracks, Traccar and OpenGTS.\n\nOn PhoneTrack main page, while watching a session, you can :\n\n*  Display location history\n*  Filter points\n*  Manually edit/add/delete points\n*  Edit devices (rename, change colour/shape, move to another session)\n*  Define geofencing zones for devices\n*  Define proximity alerts for device pairs\n*  Share a session to other Nextcloud users or with a public link (read-only)\n*  Generate public share links with optional restrictions (filters, device name, last positions only, geofencing simplification)\n*  Import/export a session in GPX format (one file with one track per device or one file per device)\n*  Display sessions statistics\n*  [Reserve a device name](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#device-name-reservation) to make sure only authorised user can log with this name\n*  Toggle session auto export and auto purge (daily/weekly/monthly)\n*  Choose what to do when point number quota is reached (block logging or delete oldest point)\n\nPublic page and public filtered page work like main page except there is only one session displayed, everything is read-only and there is no need to be logged in.\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 17 with Firefox 57+ and Chromium.\n\nThis app is compatible with theming colours and accessibility themes !\n\nThis app is under development.\n\n## Install\n\nSee the [AdminDoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc) for installation details.\n\nCheck [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#change-log) file to see what's new and what's coming in next release.\n\nCheck [AUTHORS](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/AUTHORS.md#authors) file to see complete list of authors.\n\n## Known issues\n\n* PhoneTrack **now works** with Nextcloud group restriction activated.

Login button appear at login page if app id specified. Settings are in \"Social login\" section of settings page.\n\n## Installation\n\nLogin to your NextCloud installation as an administrator and under \"Apps\" click \"Download and enable\" next to the \"Social Login\" app.\n\nSee below for setup and configuration instructions.\n\n\n\n## Custom OAuth2/OIDC groups\n\nYou can use groups from your custom provider. For that you should specify \"Groups claim\" in custom OAuth2/OIDC provider settings. That claim should be returned from provider in `id_token` or at user info endpoint. Format should be `array` or comma separated string. Eg (with claim named `roles`)\n\n```json\n{\"roles\": [\"admin\", \"user\"]}\nor\n{\"roles\": \"admin,user\"}\n```\n\nAlso nested claims is supported. For example `resource_access.client-id.roles` for\n\n```json\n\"resource_access\": {\n   \"client-id\": {\n     \"roles\": [\n       \"client-role-1\",\n       \"client-role-2\"\n     ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\n\nYou can use provider groups in two ways:\n\n1. Map provider groups to existing nextcloud groups\n2. Create provider groups in nextcloud and associate it to user (if appropriate option specified)\n\nIf you want sync groups on every login do not forget to check \"Update user profile every login\" setting\n\nYou can find example how to configure WSO2IS for return roles claim with OIDC at https://medium.com/@dewni.matheesha/claim-mapping-and-retrieving-end-user-information-in-wso2is-cffd5f3937ff\n\n## Telegram\n\nAdd [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather)\n```\n/newbot\nnameof_bot\n```\n\n&gt;Save the API key somewhere you will need to put it in nextcloud along with your bot username in the social login section.\n\n[Go here](https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login)\n\nAdd your bot username and change the authoriazation type to \"Redirect to URL\"\nEnter your nextcloud domain followed by:\n\n`/apps/sociallogin/oauth/telegram`\n\n```\nhttps://cloud.nextcloud.com/apps/sociallogin/oauth/telegram\n```\nLogin with Telegram\n\nGo back to BotFather\n\n```\n/mybots\n```\nSelect your bot\n```\n/setdomain\ncloud.nextcloud.com\n```\nGo to your nextcloud settings social login admin page.\nEnter your Telegram bot name\n```\nnameof_bot\n```\nand your API key that you copied when you created your bot\n\nAnd thats it\n\nFor using telegram login you need create bot and connect it to domain as described here https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login\n\nThen specify bot login and token in \"Social login\" section of admin settings page\n\n**Telegram auth will not work everywhere another than browser.***\n\n## Built-in OAuth providers\n\nYou can copy link of certain login button to get proper \"redirect url\" for OAuth app setting.\n\n* [Google](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/google.md)\n* [Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/loginwithamazon/console/site/lwa/overview.html)\n* [Facebook](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/facebook.md)\n* [Twitter](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/twitter.md)\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers)\n* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me#top)\n\nDetails about \"Allow login only from specified domain\" google setting you can find here [#44](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/issues/44)\nYou can use comma separated list for multiple domains\n\n## Config\n\nYou can use `'social_login_auto_redirect' =&gt; true` setting in `config.php` for auto redirect unauthorized users to social login if only one provider is configured.\nIf you want to temporary disable this function (e.g. for login as local admin), you can add `noredir=1` query parameter in url for login page. Something like `https://cloud.domain.com/login?noredir=1`\n\n## Hint\n\n### About Callback(Reply) Url\nYou can copy link from specific login button on login page and paste it on provider's website as callback url!\nSome users may get strange reply(Callback) url error from provider even if you pasted the right url, that's because your nextcloud server may generate http urls when you are actually using https.\nPlease set 'overwriteprotocol' =&gt; 'https', in your config.php file.",
