Breaking the boundaries between your Mobile &amp; Desktop devices and your Server.\n\nWebsites will be accessible through URLs like `https://cloud.example.com/sites/my_site/` and consist of just a bunch of `.md` text files in a user's Nextcloud files. `.md` stands for [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - a super simple and intuitive markup to create headings, paragraphs, text formatting, lists, images and links. But don't despair - you don't have to learn yet another language if you don't want to. Consider enabling Nextcloud's [Text](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/text) or [Markdown Editor](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_markdown) apps to make easy things stupidly simple. But what about meta data like a page's title or release date? Guess right, it's all in one place. At the top of your Markdown files you can place a block with such meta data - called the [**YAML**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) Front Matter. Creating websites can't be easier...\n\nBut that wasn't everything... Pico CMS for Nextcloud is highly customizable. You can change Picos appearance by using custom themes and add new functionality by using custom plugins. For security reasons users can neither add custom themes nor plugins on their own - but as an admin you can. Plugins and themes arent just new \"skins\" or \"widgets\", the underlying technologies are powerful frameworks you can leverage to make your users' websites truly unique. However, with great power comes great responsibility. Pico CMS for Nextcloud does its best to prevent users from including scripts into websites, since this might bear security risks (so called \"Cross Scripting\"). Since this risk doesn't apply to Pico itself, 3rd-party developers of plugins and themes might not be aware of this issue - so be careful when installing custom plugins and themes.\n\nYou want to learn more about Pico CMS for Nextcloud? Easy! Just download and enable the app from [Nextcloud's App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/cms_pico) and navigate to Nextcloud's settings page. As an admin you'll find two \"Pico CMS\" sections in your Nextcloud settings - one below \"Personal\", another below \"Administration\". The latter allows you to add custom themes, plugins and templates to Pico, as well as tweaking some advanced settings. The \"Pico CMS\" section below \"Personal\" exists for all Nextcloud users and allows one to create personal websites. Simply create your first personal website and choose \"sample_pico\" as website template. Pico's sample contents will explain all you need to know...",

Each member has a balance computed from the project bills. This way you can see who owes the group and who the group owes. Ultimately you can ask for a settlement plan telling you which payments to make to reset members balances.\n\nProject members are independent from Nextcloud users. Projects can be accessed and modified by people without a Nextcloud account.

It works for publications formatted according to the following standards:\n\n - [Epub]\n - [PDF]\n - [CBR and CBZ] ('comics')\n\nFor Epub Reader uses the futurepress [epub.js] renderer to provide near-native looks, especially when used full-screen. Turn pages by pressing the left/right hand side of the screen/window or using the cursor keys (if you have those), use the sidebar to browse through chapters or bookmarks and add annotations.\n\nPDF is handled by Mozilla's [pdf.js] renderer in combination with a custom reader app to enable side-by-side display, batch search and more. Controls are like those used in the Epub renderer with a few exceptions, e.g. night mode has not been implemented yet.\n\nCBR and CBZ are supported using a custom renderer inspired by [balaclark]'s work. As with Epub, books can be navigated using the keyboard as well as mouse or touch navigation. Reader generates a visual index of all pages, show in the sidebar (thumbnail generation can be disabled for low-memory and/or -speed devices). As CBx files are often of varying quality, a set of image enhancement filters are provided.\n\nSee [README] for more exhaustive information on features and potential misfeatures of this app\n\n   [epub.js]: https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js\n   [Epub]: http://idpf.org/epub\n   [CBR and CBZ]: https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/CBR_and_CBZ\n   [balaclark]: https://github.com/balaclark/HTML5-Comic-Book-Reader\n   [PDF]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format\n   [pdf.js]: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js\n   [README]: https://github.com/e-alfred/epubreader/blob/master/epubreader/README.md",

Defaults are always off and each user controls enabling/disabling face detection. Images from every directory can be excluded from face detection, if needed.\n- ** Power of AI:** FaceRecognition app leverages power of AI and already built neural network models through extensive usage of [DLib](http://dlib.net/) library.\n- ** Build your own thing:** FaceRecognition app is just a basic building block. Through FaceRecognition API, you can build your advanced scenarios - automatically add tags to images, connect contacts and persons, share images from specific person... We want to hear your ideas!",

Files can be loaded in GpxEdit interface or in Files app.\n\nGo to [GpxEdit Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/gpxedit) if you want to help to translate this app in your language.\n\nThis is not a perfect GPX editor.\n\nWhat's saved :\n- metadata\n    - name\n    - link url\n    - link text\n- tracks\n    - name\n    - comment\n    - description\n    - points\n        - coordinates\n        - elevation (just preserves loaded values)\n        - time (just preserves loaded values)\n- waypoint\n    - coordinates\n    - name\n    - comment\n    - description\n    - symbol\n    - elevation (just preserves loaded value)\n    - time (just preserves loaded values)\n\nGpxEdit does load/save time data.

If no time information is missing in an animation section and the \"use real time proportions\" is enabled (by default, it is), the animation duration will not change but the animation speed will be proportional to real speed.\n\nTo define an animation, go to GpxMotion main page and load a GPX file already containing ordered tracks/routes. Then define the animation steps. Then check you are satisfied with the animation preview. Then save the result to a GPX file (the animation data is saved as JSON in the GPX description field).\n\nIf a file is publicly shared without password in \"Files\" app, you can produce a GpxMotion public link to its animation with the \"Share\" button in the \"view\" page.\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 16 with Firefox and Chromium.\n\nAny feedback will be appreciated.\n\nGo to [GpxMotion Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/gpxmotion) if you want to help to translate this app in your language.\n\n## Installation\n\nCheck the [AdminDoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/gpxmotion-oc/wikis/admindoc) for installation details and integration in \"Files\" app.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nIf you look for alternatives, take a look at :\n- [gpxanim](https://github.com/rvl/gpxanim) creates a video file\n- [GPX Animator](http://zdila.github.io/gpx-animator/) creates a video file\n\n\n\n\n## Donation\n\nI develop this app during my free time.\n\n* [Donate with Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=66PALMY8SF5JE) (you don't need a paypal account)\n* [Donate with Liberapay : ![Donate using Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/eneiluj/donate)",

In the Files view, an audio file can be played with one click and the playback continues to the next files of the folder or playlist until stopped. The app includes also a server compatible with Ampache and Subsonic clients, allowing playback and browsing of the library on various external applications e.g. on Android or iPhone.\n\nWhen browser and OS support available, the Music app can be controlled with the media keys (play/pause/stop/next/prev) on the keyboard or the OS notification center even when the browser is not focused. This is supported at least on Chrome and Edge (tested on Windows 10 and Android).\n\nThe admin may set up connection to the Last.fm service, allowing the Music app to show biography and background information of the artists, albums, and tracks.\n\nLimitations: The app can handle libraries of more than 50 000 tracks on modern desktop browsers, but the user experience is optimized for somewhat smaller collections. Libraries significantly larger than this may fail to function altogether. The playback from Files works regardless of the collection size.",

That for example enables you to search in it.\n\n## Prerequisites, Requirements and Dependencies\nThe OCR app has some prerequisites:\n\n - [Nextcloud 16 and up](https://nextcloud.com/)\n\n - Only supported on latest modern web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, Safari*)\n\n - Tesseract traineddata needs about 200 MB space on your server (will be installed automatically).\n\n\n_* On Safari there is currently a problem with the [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), that requires an Administrator to set the 'script-src' to 'unsafe-eval' such that the app works properly. Because this is quite insecure the app itself does not set it and recommends to decide that on your own risk (please make sure, that you know what CSP is and what e.g. unsafe-eval causes)._\n\n## Installation\nInstall the app from the [Nextcloud AppStore](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/ocr) or download the release package from github (**NOT** the sources) and place the content in **nextcloud/apps/ocr/**.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThe software is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR\nCONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n\n## Note\nThe version 3 and earlier versions are not supported/maintained anymore by the author. So for asynchronous background processing please fork the repository and use the \"not-maintained\" branch to work on improvements. The author wasn't able to support it because of too much effort.\nMoreover this project is based on a webassembly port of tesseract. The maintainer stopped working on PDF processing in this app and will start working on separate app for pdf handling.",

Choose the [logging method](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#logging-methods) you prefer.\n* Watch the session's devices location in real time (or not) in PhoneTrack or share it with public pages.\n\n(\\*) Don't forget to set the device name in the link (rather than in the logging app settings). Replace \"yourname\" with the desired device name. Setting the device name in logging app settings only works with Owntracks, Traccar and OpenGTS.\n\nOn PhoneTrack main page, while watching a session, you can :\n\n*  Display location history\n*  Filter points\n*  Manually edit/add/delete points\n*  Edit devices (rename, change colour/shape, move to another session)\n*  Define geofencing zones for devices\n*  Define proximity alerts for device pairs\n*  Share a session to other Nextcloud users or with a public link (read-only)\n*  Generate public share links with optional restrictions (filters, device name, last positions only, geofencing simplification)\n*  Import/export a session in GPX format (one file with one track per device or one file per device)\n*  Display sessions statistics\n*  [Reserve a device name](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#device-name-reservation) to make sure only authorised user can log with this name\n*  Toggle session auto export and auto purge (daily/weekly/monthly)\n*  Choose what to do when point number quota is reached (block logging or delete oldest point)\n\nPublic page and public filtered page work like main page except there is only one session displayed, everything is read-only and there is no need to be logged in.\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 17 with Firefox 57+ and Chromium.\n\nThis app is compatible with theming colours and accessibility themes !\n\nThis app is under development.\n\n## Install\n\nSee the [AdminDoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc) for installation details.\n\nCheck [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#change-log) file to see what's new and what's coming in next release.\n\nCheck [AUTHORS](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/AUTHORS.md#authors) file to see complete list of authors.\n\n## Known issues\n\n* PhoneTrack **now works** with Nextcloud group restriction activated. See [admindoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc#issue-with-phonetrack-restricted-to-some-groups-in-nextcloud).\n\nAny feedback will be appreciated.\n\n## Donation\n\nI develop this app during my free time.\n\n* [Donate with Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=66PALMY8SF5JE) (you don't need a paypal account)\n* [Donate with Liberapay : ![Donate using Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/eneiluj/donate)",

Login button appear at login page if app id specified. Settings are in \"Social login\" section of settings page.\n\n## Installation\n\nLogin to your NextCloud installation as an administrator and under \"Apps\" click \"Download and enable\" next to the \"Social Login\" app.\n\nSee below for setup and configuration instructions.\n\n\n\n## Custom OAuth2/OIDC groups\n\nYou can use groups from your custom provider. For that you should specify \"Groups claim\" in custom OAuth2/OIDC provider settings. That claim should be returned from provider in `id_token` or at user info endpoint. Format should be `array` or comma separated string. Eg (with claim named `roles`)\n\n```json\n{\"roles\": [\"admin\", \"user\"]}\nor\n{\"roles\": \"admin,user\"}\n```\n\nAlso nested claims is supported. For example `resource_access.client-id.roles` for\n\n```json\n\"resource_access\": {\n   \"client-id\": {\n     \"roles\": [\n       \"client-role-1\",\n       \"client-role-2\"\n     ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\n\nYou can use provider groups in two ways:\n\n1. Map provider groups to existing nextcloud groups\n2. Create provider groups in nextcloud and associate it to user (if appropriate option specified)\n\nIf you want sync groups on every login do not forget to check \"Update user profile every login\" setting\n\nYou can find example how to configure WSO2IS for return roles claim with OIDC at https://medium.com/@dewni.matheesha/claim-mapping-and-retrieving-end-user-information-in-wso2is-cffd5f3937ff\n\n## Built-in OAuth providers\n\nYou can copy link of certain login button to get proper \"redirect url\" for OAuth app setting.\n\n* [Google](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/google.md)\n* [Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/loginwithamazon/console/site/lwa/overview.html)\n* [Facebook](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/facebook.md)\n* [Twitter](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/twitter.md)\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers)\n* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me#top)\n* [Telegram](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/telegram.md)\n\nDetails about \"Allow login only from specified domain\" google setting you can find here [#44](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/issues/44)\nYou can use comma separated list for multiple domains\n\n## Config\n\nYou can use `'social_login_auto_redirect' =&gt; true` setting in `config.php` for auto redirect unauthorized users to social login if only one provider is configured.\nIf you want to temporary disable this function (e.g. for login as local admin), you can add `noredir=1` query parameter in url for login page. Something like `https://cloud.domain.com/login?noredir=1`\n\n## Hint\n\n### About Callback(Reply) Url\nYou can copy link from specific login button on login page and paste it on provider's website as callback url. To make proper button visible, just fill certain provider settings with random data and change it later.\n\nSome users may get strange reply(Callback) url error from provider even if you pasted the right url, that's because your nextcloud server may generate http urls when you are actually using https.\nPlease set 'overwriteprotocol' =&gt; 'https', in your config.php file.",
